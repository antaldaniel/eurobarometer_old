# eurobarometer

The goal of eurobarometer is to provide a consistent importing facility to R.

## Installation

You can install eurobarometer from github with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("antaldaniel/eurobarometer")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/haven")
```
In some cases, there may be memory handling issues when reading in GESIS SPSS files in haven 1.1.1. This issue appears to be fixed in the development version (and do not persist if you still use 1.1.0).

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## basic example code
```
