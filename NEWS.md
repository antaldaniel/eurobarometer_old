# eurobarometer 0.1.0

* The package is detached from the more general surveyreader, and does not handle multi-language surveys. Currently it is aimed to correctly handle the Eurobarometer archives of GESIS, and provide pre-processing support for the integration or presentation of multi-language surveys.
